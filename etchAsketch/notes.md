Cells dont generate unless the row and cell vars are defined within the loop

10/11 - Can't understand why the clear button isn't functioning. I can use it to change the BG color of the 
grid parent container but the inner cell elements won't change. Thinking it may be a case of needing to iterate
through the collection?

10/12 - Checked in w chatGPT and realized that I was fixating on the approach of changing the background color
of each cell, but a simpler solution is to just run the grid generating function over again with the supplied
slider number. Wondering if it could still be done through styling.
